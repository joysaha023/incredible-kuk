<p>Description -:Jyotisar is the place where the sacred Jyotisar, the birth place of Gita, is the most venerated tirtha of Kurukshetra. It is believed that Mahabharata battle started from Jyotisar, where on the eve of the battle deluded Arjuna received the eternal message of Gita from its propounder Lord Krishna. It is said that Adi Sankaracharya has identified the place during his sojourn to Himalaya in the 9th centenary of Christian era. In 1850 A.D. King of Kashmir constructed one Shiva temple at the tirtha. Again in 1924, King of Darbhanga raised a stone platform around the holy banyan tree, which according to devouts is the evidence of the song celestial i.e Gita. In 1967 Sankaracharya of Kanchi Kama Koti Peetha. Installed the Chariot showing Gita Updesha on the platform facing east. The tirtha in the past might be comprising the ancient temple, but they could not sustain because of the fury of the invaders in medieval times. Architectural member of one such temple of 9th-10th century is placed on the main platform of the temple. The Haryana, Tourism is running a light and sound show daily here in Hindi and English in the evening.Jyotisar tirth was renovated and continuously being upgraded by the Kurukshetra Development Board.
